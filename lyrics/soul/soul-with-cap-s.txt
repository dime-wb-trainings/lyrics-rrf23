Now I'm not liking country, and I'm not rappin' rap
You can make a man swing, just say my thing
No, I'm talkin' to dig, my step
The only thing that turns me on is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S

Music makes you happy, thinking makes you sad
It can do the worst thing to the best you ever had
For entertainment found you if I had to choose
You and me might disagree cause I like rythm and blues


Now I'm not missing disco, I'm not saying punk is bunk
I can't settle for heavy metal cause I got to have that funk
The only thing that turns me on is when I hear a soulful song
