Grey light, new day leaks through the window
And some old soul song comes on the alarm clock radio
We walk the forty blocks to the middle
Of the place we heard where everything would be
And there were barracades to keep us off the street
But the crowd kept pushing forward
Until they swallowed the police
Yeah, they went wild
Yeah, they went wild
Yeah, they went wild
We left before the dust had time to settle
And all the broken glass swept off the avenue
And on the way home I held your camera like a bible
Just wishing so bad that it held some kind of truth
And I stood nervous next to you in the dark room
You dropped the paper in the water
And it all begins to bloom
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
And just when I get so lonesome I can't speak
I see some flowers on a hillside
Like a wall of new TVs
Yeah, they go wild
Hey
