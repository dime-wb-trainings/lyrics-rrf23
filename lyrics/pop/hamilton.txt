Angelica: Chorus:
A toast to the groom (To the groom x3)
To the bride (To the Bride x3)
From your sister (Angelica x3)
Is always by your side (By your side x2)
To your union (To the union) (to the revolution)
And the hope that you provide (Provide, you provide)
May you always (Always)
Be satisfied (Rewind)

Angelica:
I remember that night I just might regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise.
I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream that you can't quite place.
But Alexander I'll never forget the first time I saw your face.
I have never been the same.
Intelligent eyes in a hunger pain fame.
And when you said hi I forgot my dang name.
You set my heart aflame, every part aflame, this is not a game.


Hamilton:
You strike me as a woman who has ever been satisfied.

Angelica:
I'm sure I don't know what you mean you forget yourself.

Hamilton:
You're like me, I'm never satisfied.

Angelica:
Is that right?

Hamilton:
I have never been satisfied

Angelica:
My name is Angelica Schuyler.

Hamilton:
Alexander Hamilton

Angelica:
Where's your family from?

Hamilton:
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done.
But just you wait, just you wait.
