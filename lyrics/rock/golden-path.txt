As I walked along the supposed golden path
I was confronted by a mysterious specter
He pointed to the graveyard over on yonder hill
And I paused in cosmic reflection
Confused and wondering of how I came to die, to die...
Hmm, I was confused
For if I was dead, how and why did I die?
But I composed myself
And decided I should face him
But I stood paralyzed on the supposed golden path
And I was confronted by a powerful demon force
They said it was the devil and when he spoke
His words flowed like glowing lava from the mouth of a volcano
And I said, "Help me Lord, I found myself in some kind of hell"
But I did not believe in a heaven and hell
World in opposite's kind of reality
And I gained control of myself
And I decided to press on
And as I walked along the supposed golden path
I was trembling with fear, all the lions and wizards yet to come
I seen in the distance silver mountains rising high
And the clouds and a voice from above did whisper
Some shining answer from the womb
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
(As I walked along)
(As I walked along) please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
(As I walked along)
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
