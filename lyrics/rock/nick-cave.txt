This morning crawls towards us, darling
With a memory in its paws
A child swims between two boats
Her mother waving from the shore, darling
And we won't get to Amsterdam

Or that lake in Africa, darling
And we won't get to anywhere
Anytime this year, darling
We won't get to anywhere, darling
Anytime this year

We won't get to anywhere, darling
Unless I dream you there
We won't get to Albuquerque
Anytime this year
We won't get to anywhere, darling
Unless you take mะต there, darling
